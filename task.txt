# 1) Use Transparent Proxy Pattern and Gnosis Multisignature wallet for the implementation.

# 2) You can refer the document under the resource section of 8th February live class to perform this task

# 3) The pattern for this upgradable contracts is divided into three phases of upgradable smart contract- Phase 1- contract version 1, Phase 2- contract version 2 and Phase 3 - contract version 3.

# 4) Phase 1- Create a simple ERC20 contract with a pre-minting of 1 million tokens

* 5) Phase 2- Add the functionality to mint and burn tokens, add allowance mechanism functions. All payable and transaction functions should be implemented using the call method.

6) Phase 3- Add Reentrancy Guard for vulnerable functions(use a custom modifier to implement reentrancy guard), add onlyOwner modifier wherever necessary(use custom modifier for this implementation).

7) Perform testing for all the phases.
